# Buildkit

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.raquo/buildkit_2.12.svg)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.raquo/buildkit_2.12)

Just a few build helpers used by [Laminar](https://github.com/raquo/laminar) and my other Scala projects.


## Documentation

For this project, there isn't any. Although the code here is not polished, its usage should be straightforward. You can see how it's used in Laminar's build, and use it in a similar way if you feel like it.

For changelog, see git commit history.

Sorry, but that's all the time I can spare for this particular project right now.
